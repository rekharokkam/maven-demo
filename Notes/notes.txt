Our project is dependent on a library ex- spring framework. Spring framework might in turn be dependent on other libraries. this is called transitive dependencies
It is possible to mention dependency scoping
POM - Project Object Model

groupId, artifactId and version number together create an address for an artifact

repositories hold all of our artifacts and dependencies

dependencies are the library files that we are dependent on
artifacts are the libraries we have generated, archetypes, plugins

2 types of repositories - Local - on the machine , Remote - we access via some type of protocol
Local repo will take precedence over remote repo when we perform dependency resolution

what is a Plug-in - is a collection of goals

goals are the actions we perform / Methods /Operations on source code.

All the work done in maven is done through plugins and goals.

Maven has lifecycle. A lifecycle is just a named sequence of events

maven has 3 lifecycles - clean, default and site
